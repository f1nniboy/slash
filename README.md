# Slash
> Your average package manager written in POSIX shell, based on KISS.

# Information
I created this fork of KISS to add features and changes I *personally* want.
I do not claim credit for the idea and code, thank Dylan for the awesome idea!

# Usage
The package manager is based on KISS, which means that the usage should be identical.

# Missing features
List of missing features, compared to KISS. Some were left out on purpose.

## Installation
Because the package manager is written in POSIX shell, you don't need to compile anything.
You can install it using `install -m755 slash /usr/bin/slash`.
